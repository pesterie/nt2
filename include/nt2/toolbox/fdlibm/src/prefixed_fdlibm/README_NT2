              THIS IS EXACTLY fdlibm EXCEPT THAT 
                    ALL FUNCTIONS DEFINED
                   HERE ARE PREFIXED BY fd_ 
                            AND
        __HI AND __LO MACROS ARE MODIFIED IN fdlibm.h
           TO INLINE CALLS fd___HI, fd___LO
         and fd__set_HI, fd__set_LO INVOLVING UNIONS
         TO AVOID NON ANSI TYPE PUNNED DEREFERENCING.


The rationale is to allow the concurrent use of fdlibm
with libc or any other C math library without name clashes,
this, to the purpose  of testing, within C or C++ environment
and permitting compilation with -O3 optimization (with gcc).
